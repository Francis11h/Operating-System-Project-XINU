Demand Paging
==

Demand paging is a method of mapping a large address space into a relatively small amount of physical memory. It allows a program to use an address space that is larger than the physical memory, and access non-contiguous sections of the physical memory in a contiguous way. Demand paging is accomplished by using a “backing store” (usually disk) to hold pages of memory that are not currently in use.
